# stackoverflow_checker
A simple script I use to check for StackOverflow questions on a given topic (PyAutoGUI, in my case).

# Installation

Just download the zip file and extract `stackoverflow_checker.py`. You'll also need the Requests and BeautifulSoup modules, which you can install with `pip3` (on Linux/Mac) or `pip` (on Windows):

    pip3 install requests
    pip3 install beautifulsoup4

# Usage

Edit the `query` variable in `stackoverflow_checker.py` and set it to the search term you want to use, then run `python3 stackoverflow_checker.py` (on Linux/Mac) or `python stackoverflow_checker.py` (on Windows).
